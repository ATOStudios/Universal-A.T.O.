**Universal A.T.O.** is a cutting-edge, HTML-based universe simulator that runs directly in your web browser. Our mission is to build a physics-based laboratory where you can orchestrate galactic collisions, dive into event horizons, and explore procedurally generated star systems with cinematic fidelity.

## 🔭 Experience the Cosmos

Currently in **Alpha**, Universal A.T.O. pushes the boundaries of WebGL technology:

* **💥 Galactic Collisions:** Witness the "Death Spiral" of galaxies. The simulation calculates gravitational mergers in real-time, creating chaotic mega-galaxies.
* **🤖 AI-Powered Lore:** Integrated with **Google Gemini 2.5**, our "Cosmic Analysis Module" generates unique scientific reports and lore for every galaxy you discover.
* **🪐 Living Worlds:** Explore specific planet types—from **Terra** and **Ocean** worlds to dangerous **Lava** and **Ice** planets—each rendered with unique, dynamic atmospheres.
* **🚀 Cinematic Warp:** Engage the warp drive with dynamic *Chromatic Aberration* effects to travel between Andromeda, the Milky Way, or your own custom-created galaxies.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood (Technical Showcase)

For tech enthusiasts, Universal A.T.O. is built on a modern stack designed for performance and visual fidelity:

* **Core Engine:** Powered by **Three.js** and **WebGL** for hardware-accelerated 3D rendering.
* **Custom GLSL Shaders:** No standard textures. Planets, accretion disks, and quasar jets are rendered using custom-written **GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)** code, featuring noise-based procedural terrain.
* **Procedural Generation:** Utilizing deterministic "Seed" algorithms to generate billions of unique star systems and nebulas on the fly.
* **Post-Processing:** Features **Unreal Bloom Pass** for realistic starlight glow and gravitational lensing effects.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/universal-ato.git](https://github.com/yourusername/universal-ato.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the project:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox). No server installation required for basic functionality.

### 🔑 API Key Configuration (Important)
To enable the AI Lore features (Google Gemini), you need an API key.
* *Note: Never commit your API key directly to GitHub.*
* Create a `secrets.js` file (ensure it is in your `.gitignore`).
* Add your key there or input it via the browser console/local storage as configured in the source.
